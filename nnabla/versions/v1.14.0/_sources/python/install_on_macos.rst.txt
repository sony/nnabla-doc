NOTE: Our testing coverage in terms of environments and machines on macOS is very limited. Please submit an issue if you face any issue.


Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We test the installation on macOS Sierra.

The following software are required for installation:

* Python>=3.6 (We'd recommend you to setup Python using Anaconda or `Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_).

  * pip (bundled in Conda Python)
  * wheel (bundled in Conda Python)
  * setuptools (bundled in Conda Python. You may need to upgrade the version of setuptools with ``pip install -U --no-deps setuptools``.)

Install
^^^^^^^

See :ref:`pip-installation-workflow` (note that the binary packages for the CUDA extension are not available for macOS. Please `build it from source <https://github.com/sony/nnabla/tree/master/doc/build/build.md>`_).
