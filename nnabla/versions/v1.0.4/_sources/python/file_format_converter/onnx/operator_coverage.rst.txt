Operator support status
=======================

Support status importing from ONNX
----------------------------------

This is a status list of [ONNX operators](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md)
that indicates if each operator can be converted to NNP.

- Not started The ONNX operator hasn't been checked if it can be converted to NNabla.
- Not implemented The ONNX operator has been checked if it can be converted to NNabla, but the implementation has not started.
- OK The ONNX operator can map to a NNabla operator.
- Not finished The solution is not perfect/finished, for example, the operator can map to a combination of NNabla operators.
- Not in NNabla Hard to find a solution with existing NNabla operators.
