Q. I want to use another linux distribution.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We actually tested other linux distributions and versions; Ubuntu 18.04,
20.04, CentOS 8, RockyLinux 8, Fedora 29 and RHEL 8 on various
environments; Baremetal server, AWS instance, and/or Docker machine.
Thus, you can install in almost the same way described here. The details
of how-to-install for each are coming soon.
